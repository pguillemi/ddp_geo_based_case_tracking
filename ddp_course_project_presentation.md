The idea
========================================================

This app aims to provide straightforward answers to some very important aspects of case monitoring (who could be patients, customers, place-specific situations).

- Where are they?
- what is their status?
- Can I update real time information regarding my current actions?


Main parts of the app
========================================================

- A leaflet map, that shows cases and can interact in several ways with displayed information
- A set of tabs that
  - Show a summary regarding all the cases
  - Update interactively with map zoom, identifying and highlighting cases
  - Show case history and allow to upload updates IN REAL TIME
  - Can create in spot new cases to follow up
- Last but not least: an online log that keeps track of all changes
  
Some current information from the app
========================================================
How many cases are currently being followed up?

The following information comes from embedded R code that reads information directly from app log: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J5o5Qzh6HbLvePldUmPQvn19NK4MM8JtKUjPdsMyOE4/edit#gid=0
